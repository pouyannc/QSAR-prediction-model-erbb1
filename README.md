## Analysis of EGFR inhibitors for building a predictive model

In this project, Python and machine learning were used in order to build a model which predicts pIC50 values of molecules for inhibiting the ErbB1 protein. Overexpression of ErbB1 has been shown to occur in some cancer cell types.

The "Drug Discovery Project EGFR.ipynb" Jupyter notebook file contains all the steps involved in data analysis and statistical model building. It includes: data collection, exploratory data analysis, descriptor calculation, model building, and model comparison.
The "bioactivity_predict_app" folder contains the model deployed as a web app via streamlit. To run the app, navigate into the folder and enter into the command line: streamlit run app.py
